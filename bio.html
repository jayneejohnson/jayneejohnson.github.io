	<h1>Biography</h1>
	
		<p>I am originally from Fort Pierce, Fla. I now reside in the Swamp with my little sister and Doxie, Ty.</p>
		<p>My father is a fourth-generation citrus farmer and cattle rancher. My agricultural roots have helped shape me the person I am today. I have the most loving parents and two little sisters. I am the oldest, and this responsibility has also contributed to the person I am today.</p>
		<p>My favorite things include: family, fashion, travel, being a foodie, public relations, writing, holidays and event planning, especially weddings.</p>
		<p>If I could incorporate public relations and event planning into one, I would have my dream job.</p>
