	<h1>Biography</h1>
	
		<p>I am originally from Fort Pierce, Fla. I now reside in the Swamp with my little sister and Doxie, Ty.</p>
		<p>My father is a fourth-generation citrus farmer and cattle rancher. My agricultural roots have helped shape me into the person I am today. I have the most loving, supportive parents and sisters. I am the oldest of three girls, and this responsibility has also contributed to the person I am today.</p>
		<p>My favorite things include: family, fashion, travel, being a foodie, public relations, writing, blogging, organizing, exercising, holidays and event planning, especially weddings.</p>
		<p>My dream job would be to incorporate public relations and event planning into one.</p>
