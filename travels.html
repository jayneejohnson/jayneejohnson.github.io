	<h1>Travels</h1>
	
	<p>Traveling is a love of mine. I never miss the opportunity to travel anywhere new.</p>
	
	<h2><strong>Great Britain</strong></h2>
	
	<p>My great-grandmother is a Welsh War Bride. She was born and raised in Cardiff, Wales. During World War II, she met my great-grandfather, a member of the United States Army. They married not long after.</p>
	<p>I have always had a special place in my heart for Great Britain due to this love story and my ancestry. In June 2007, I had the amazing opportunity to travel to England and Wales with my great-grandmother, mother and best friend.</p>
	<p>We traveled Great Britain for two weeks, and we squeezed as much travel as possible into that time frame. I look forward to going back to visit my family there and to explore more areas of the country.</p>
